# EvernoteWear

![logo](mobile/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

## Overview

I've started this project with the goal of creating an Evernote client for Android Wear using the official [Evernote Android SDK](https://github.com/evernote/evernote-sdk-android). 
My main issues with the official client are (as May 2017) the lack of consistency with the Wear design guidelines and lack of ambient display mode. Right now I'm no longer working on this project.

## Features

- Android Wear 
- Ambient display
- Google now integration
- Note synchronization 
- Note search

## Missing stuff

- Task list support
- Image support
